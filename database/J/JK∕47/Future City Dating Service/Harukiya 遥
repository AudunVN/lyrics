They fade into each other's features
While ... with jealousy from the bedroom ... desk

Two people who for some reason, and against the odds
Have managed to withstand everything

Within this is the ... beneath the mystery
The two people
... part to the same soul
Now ... each other
Into the stars at peace

... tomorrow say otherwise
And the tomorrow after that

They
