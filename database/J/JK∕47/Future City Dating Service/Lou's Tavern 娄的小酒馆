The room was buzzing with chugging of poor exhaust from the cooling system
And the smell of tobacco, chocolate, and cigarettes
The taste of wine and beer

They initiated to take breaths and share tantrums
As if they were ...
Letting their secrets become the last frontier of intimacy
They could do no wrong focused on each other
They advance into one another's personal gate
Disregarding all forms of engagement

Her hand gripped the back of his hair
And her gentle biting as he wrapped his arms around her
She missed touching him

She wanted to wrap herself within his body
And remain a prisoner inside his heart

He lays to rest his active mind
And dreams inside her subconscious
To allow her to whisper dreams to him

He wanted to take her into the movie of himself
And allow her to watch the tale of his life from every plot twist:
Fall, and ache, and tearjerk
Rendered in amazing Hi-Def IMAX
For the first time
Just for her
