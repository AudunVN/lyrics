[The beauty of their souls, the sweetness of their characters live on with us forever]

Sit in darkness
Understand what I am is what I am
Overshadowed by assertion makes me certain

Solemn ponder wander shake
Shaded with a doubt nightmare
Full of fear

Solvent raining from the skies
Backlog danger hypnotize
Glass blown eyes

Stain in drain on
Procreate
Fascinate me instiage/ care to here

Morbid desert
Icecream eyes
So deceiving
Fraternize carerully

Create vision
Fabricate
Smash to pieces
Watch and wait
Crash glass houses

Hasten grasp on calculate
Foreign objects fornicate
Smash glass houses (glass houses)

Smash to pieces
Watch and wait
Crash glass houses

Hasten grasp on calculate
Foreign objects fornicate
Smash glass houses

Misinterpret reprimand
Are you here
Myself demands
Mediocre are you hearing headspace clearing

Solemn ponder wander shake
Shaded with a doubt nightmare
Full of fear

Solvent raining from the skies
Backlog danger hypnotize
Glass blown eyes

Stain in drain on
Procreate
Fascinate me instiage/ care to here

Morbid desert
Icecream eyes
So deceiving
Fraternize carerully

Create vision
Fabricate
Smash to pieces
Watch and wait
Hasten grasp on calculate
Foreign objects fornicate

Hasten grasp on calculate
Foreign objects fornicate

Smash glass houses

Smash glass houses

Smash glass houses

Smash glass houses

Oh, smash glass houses

Oh, smash glass houses

Smash glass houses

[The beauty of their souls, the sweetness of their characters live on with us forever]
