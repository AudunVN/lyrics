...
Your actions won't
Hurt me again

I missed my chance
To tell you how I felt
So I better just carry on

(Just give it up and carry on)
(Just give it up and carry on)
(Just give it up and carry on)

I see it now, your ... pave the way
The ... light of day

I missed my chance to bring you back again
So I better just carry on

(Just give it up and carry on)
(Just give it up and carry on)
(Just give it up and carry on)
(Just give it up and carry on)
(Just give it up and carry on)
(Just give it up and carry on)
