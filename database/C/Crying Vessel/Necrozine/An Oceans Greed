It means everything
Last true symphony
My future’s case
...

Crashing waves ...
I couldn’t have asked for more
You are my everything
Not a second’s missed

I am falling ...
I will ...
We will skip ...
Nothing’s coming between you and I

...
Come right back to me
...
Looking out for kiss

...
Give me a late night call
You are my everything
And not a second’s missed

Not a second’s missed

I am falling ...
I will ...
We will skip ...
Nothing’s coming between you and I

Between you and I
