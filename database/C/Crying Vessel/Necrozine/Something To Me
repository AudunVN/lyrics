Put your body close to mine
... pushes back in line
... your thighes and you light pale skin
... late night inn
Animal instincts ... until you are mine
... beneath the sheets

...
...
...
...
...
...

You’re something else
You’re something to me
You’re something else
You’re something to me

...
Blessful needs
....
Just say the word
And I’ll make you mine
Nothing is right ... fine
...
Stepping into my room ...
... don't forget the chase
It always feels better
... face

...
...
...
...
...
...

You’re something else
You’re something to me
You’re something else
You’re something to me

You’re something to me

You’re something to me
You’re something to me
You’re something to me
You’re something to me
