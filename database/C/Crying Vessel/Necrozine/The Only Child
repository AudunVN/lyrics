[You bring delivery]

You wear this bashful shame
Like it’s under a myth
And these tideous pains
Should never come clean

It seems like you never want
Very well rehearsed
Throwing out the lines
That were never deserved

Like an angel
Of darkened means
Like a child
Of hunger and means

We are sorry
This happened to you
...
You’ll get how I feel

You wear this bashful shame
Like it’s under a myth
And these tideous pains
Should never come clean

It seems like you never want
Very well rehearsed
Throwing out the lines
That were never deserved

Like an angel
Of darkened means
Like a child
Of hunger and means

We are sorry
This happened to you
...
You’ll get how I feel
