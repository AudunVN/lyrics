You said you’re God’s gift to men
Though I beg to differ
If I care
Move to the music for me
It will ... feel better
On the other side
On the other side
When you take my hand

You act as if you know me
Then my heart surrenders
With you by my side
Taking the steps ...
It is ... much greener
On the other side

On the other side
On the other side
On the other side
On the other side
When you take my hand

On the other side
On the other side
When you take my hand
