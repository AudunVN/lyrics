He sat still on a flower
such a small butterfly
and I took him very carefully
in my hand

Then I felt him trembling
and I let him free again
and I called out after him:
fly into a lovely country
because for you there are no borders
and nobody stops you
you are so light
you fly on a breath of wind

And I was a little jealous
because he just flew away so freely
and I wished so much
I could do the same

Butterfly, Butterfly, Butterfly
fly away with all my love
carry the spark of hope
into every heart
let people be free
and happy again

Butterfly, Butterfly, Butterfly
I wish so much to be like you
for you fly over borders
and walls with the wind
and you make it
so that we are all happy

And in my mind I saw him fly
over land and sea
and the people watched him
friendly and smiling
and they stopped their squabbling
and they called out: Butterfly!
we would all like to be
as carefree as you

He saw Holland's Tulip fields
and the roses in Versailles
and in Germany the forget-me-not bloomed
England's blue hope flower
in Athens the red poppy
all the flowers of this world
in the sunshine

Butterfly, Butterfly, Butterfly
fly away with all my love
carry the spark of hope
into every heart
let people again be free
and happy

Butterfly, Butterfly, Butterfly
I wish so much to be like you
for you fly over borders
and walls with the wind
and you make it
so that we are all happy

Suddenly I saw the shadow over him
and a black bird pushed him down
but my friend floated safely away unscathed
lucky Butterfly!

Butterfly, Butterfly, Butterfly
fly away with all my love
carry the spark of hope
into every heart
let people be free
and happy again

Butterfly, Butterfly, Butterfly
I wish so much to be like you
for you fly over borders
and walls with the wind
and you make it
so that we are all happy

Sometimes I wish so much
I could always be with you
Fly away Butterfly, Butterfly...
